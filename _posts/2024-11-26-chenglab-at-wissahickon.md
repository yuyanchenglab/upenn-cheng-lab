We came to lab early and carpooled to Wissahickon to hike up the trail!

Despite the direct hit from a bird above, Jeff doesn't let that ruin this spirit.

It started out woody, but we eventually made it to the meadow of amber grains.

Leaving the meadow and back through the woods, we introduced ourselves to a ginger cat. It especially liked Cass!

We finished this trip at U-Town on Albert's recommendation. We ended up filling our bellies and chatting while sneaking peaks at the Korean soap drama on the TV across from us.

Thank you to our nature navigator, Gaby, and to the trip coordinators, Gaby and Cass!
