Jeff graduated from Rowan University and from Boston Universityâ€™s Masters in Bioinformatics program. During COVID, Jeff joined Emory University to work as a Data Analyst in the Immunology lab of Dr. Jeremy Boss across the street from the CDC. Along with various multi-omic analyses, he spent much energy trying to make himself redundant, educating the rest of the lab on bioinformatics analysis and encouraging the wet lab to branch out. Back home in Philadelphia, he joins the Cheng Lab to lead its bioinformatics within the Molecular Ophthalmology department at the University of Pennsylvania.
