Albert is an undergraduate studying computer science and economics. His role in the lab is as a data analyst, using single-cell and spatial data to search for genetic markers that correlate with glaucoma in patients. Outside of academics, I am an avid squash player and a member of The Mask and Wig Club, a musical comedy company at Penn.
