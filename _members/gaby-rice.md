Gabriella received her B.S. with honors in Biology from the University of Texas at San Antonio, before going on to earn a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Pennsylvania under the mentorship of Panteleimon Rompolas. For her dissertation, she utilized genetic mouse models and intravital imaging techniques based on two-photon microscopy, to investigate the role of the transcription factor SOX9 in the maintenance of epidermal tissues and appendages. As a postdoctoral researcher in the Cheng lab, Gabriella will apply single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics to investigate the dynamic cellular and molecular changes that occur during the early onset of glaucoma.
